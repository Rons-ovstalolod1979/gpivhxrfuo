I just got out of The Electric State, and, wow, my brain feels a bit fried, like a robot that's been retired too soon. Does that make sense? Probably not, but here we are. This movie managed to jolt me with its oddball charm, even though I swear my seat had a spring poking into my butt the entire time. I mean, futuristic worlds are cool and all, but how about theater seats that don’t feel like they're from the Stone Age?

Anyway, let me try to unpack this. It's like they threw in a blender all the nostalgia of the 90s, a touch of dystopia, and some oddly emotional robots. Seriously, they made me care about machines. Aren't they just supposed to beep and boop? But no, here I am, feeling some kind of way about circuits and metal. It’s exhausting, this empathy. I'm still processing if that's a good thing or if I need more sleep.

> Speaking of processing, the landscape in the movie was so familiar and yet not. Like an alternate version of my hometown if someone decided to replace all the trees with gigantic robot skeletons. Dreamy freaky stuff that makes you question if you remembered to unplug the toaster before leaving the house.

Sarcasm aside, I got lost in the visuals. Every scene was like a painting you stare at too long, and suddenly, it stares back at you. It’s like that weird eye contact moment with an attractive stranger on the subway... if that stranger were a 30-foot tall android.

Here’s something random that popped into my head—and bear with me because logic took a vacation during this film. You know those vending machines that always seem empty when you want something sweet? It felt like every hope was just out of reach, press a button and get nada. Life’s a vending machine, or maybe that’s just what happens when you watch movies while still slightly annoyed from work.

I think they might have gotten something right, though. Or maybe I just need to download the movie and scrutinize frames for Easter eggs or hidden charms. The Electric State is like a jigsaw puzzle that you try to piece together after a night out. Exhausting, for sure, but somehow captivating. Like, should I be contemplating the intricacies of AI or just admiring the pretty pictures, or what?

Maybe my rambling won't make you rush to watch the movie, but if you're into feeling both tired and fascinated, maybe give it a shot. Maybe, just maybe, you'll walk out wondering if you’re part machine too. Don't say I didn't warn you.
